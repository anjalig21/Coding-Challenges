;; A nested list of X (nested-listof X) is one of:
;; * empty
;; * (cons (nested-listof X) (nested-listof X))
;; * (cons X (nested-listof X))

;; (super-foldr combine base nested-list) consumes a
;; function, combine, a base and a nested list. It then generalizes
;; foldr to  work on nested lists of non-list elements, folding each nested
;; list with the given function to produce the result to be used in
;; the parent listâ€™s fold.

;; Examples
(check-expect (super-foldr + 0 '(1 (5 5 (1 3)) (10 2) 2)) 29)
(check-expect (super-foldr - 0 '(1 (5 5 (1 3)) (10 2) 2)) 9)
(check-expect (super-foldr (lambda (val sofar)
                             (cond [(string? val) (+ (string-length val) sofar)]
                                   [(number? val) (+ val sofar)])) 0 '("pancho" "lefty" ("my" "proud" "mountains")
                                                                                ("tecumseh" "valley"))) 41)

;; (magnitudes nl) consumes a nested list and produces the sum of all

;; Examples

;; (super-filter pred nl) consumes a predicate, pred
;; and a nested list, nl and applies the filter function
;; on a nested list.

;; Examples
(check-expect (super-filter odd? '(1 (2 (2 3 4) 5 6 (7 8 9)) 10 11 12))
              '(1 ((3) 5 (7 9)) 11))
